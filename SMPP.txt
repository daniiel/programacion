--  SMPP Short Message Peer to Peer
-- ---------------------------------

SMSC - Short Message Service Centre
ESME - External Short Message Entity

SMPP supports a full featured set of two-way messaging functions 
such as:

    . transmit message from an ESME to single or multiple destinations
        via the SMSC.
    . an ESME may receive message via the SMSC from other SME's 
    . query the status of a short message stored on the SMSC


PDUs - Protocol Data Units

SMPP Protocol Definition
-------------------------- 

The SMPP Protocol defines:

    . a set of operations and associated Protocol Data Units (PDUs) for the 
        exchange of short messages between an ESME and an SMSC.
    . tha data an ESME application can exchange with an SMSC during SMPP 
        operations

    *NOTE: Every SMPP operation must consist of a request PDU and associated
        response PDU.

        The receiving entity must return the associated SMPP response to an
        SMPP PDU request.

There are 3 types or transactions:

    . messages sent from the ESME (transmitter) to the SMSC
    . messages sent from the SMSC to ESME (receiver)
    . messages sent from the ESME (transceiver) to the SMSC and messages sent
        from the SMSC to the ESME (transceiver)

SMPP session description

    An SMPP session between an SMSC and an ESME is initiated by the ESME first 
    establishing a network connection with the SMSC and then issuing (emitir) an
    SMPP bind request to open an SMPP session.

    An ESME wishing to submit and receive messages is required to establish 2 
    network connections and 2 SMPP sessions (transmitter and reciver).

    The SMPP sessions states:

        . OPEN (connected and bind pending)
            an ESME has established a network connection to the SMSC but has not
            yet issued a bind request.

        . BOUND_TX
            a connected ESME has requested to bind as an ESME transmitter 
            (by issuing a bind_transmiter PDU) and has received a response from the 
            SMSC authorising its bind request.

        . BOUND_RX
            a connected ESME has request to bind as an ESME receiver (by issuing
            a bind_receiver PDU) and has received a response from the SMSC authorising
            its bind request.

        . BOUND_TRX
            a connected ESME has requestto bind as an ESME transceiver (by issuing a 
            bind_transceiver PDU) and has received a response from the SMSC authorising
            its bind request. An ESME bound as a transceiver supports the complete set of 
            operations supported by a transmitter ESME and a receiver ESME.

        . CLOSED
            An ESME has unboung from the SMSC and has closed the network connection. The
            SMSC may also unbind from the ESME.

    OUTBIND

    The purpose of the 'outbind' operation is to allow the SMSC signal an ESME to originate
    a bind_receiver request to the SMSC.

    sample outbind sequence.

        ESME                      SMSC
          |         outbind         |
          |<------------------------|
          |     bind_receiver       |
          |------------------------>|
          |   bind_receiver_resp    |
          |<------------------------|
          |     deliver_sm          |
          |<------------------------|
          |     deliver_sm_resp     |
          |------------------------>|
          |                         |
